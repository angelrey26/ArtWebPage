        <p>The Rijksmuseum</p>

        <p>
        The Rijksmuseum is the museum of the Netherlands. In 2013, an entirely renovated Rijksmuseum opened its doors to the public. <br>
        They are greeted by a stunning building, amazing interior design, wonderful exhibitions, lively events, and many fine amenities for young and old.
        </p>

        <p>Mission</p>

        At the Rijksmuseum, art and history take on new meaning for a broad-based, contemporary national and international audience.
